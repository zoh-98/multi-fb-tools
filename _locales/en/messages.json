In a post, if the person comments multiple times, it will still only count as 1 interaction.<br />- Messages: The total number of messages exchanged between you and the person.<br />- Inactive: Inactive: Whether the person's profile is active or not. Note: It is possible that the person does not use Facebook but still uses Messenger.<br />- Total: The sum of the displayed criteria.<br />The number of friends displayed on your Facebook is also not an exact number. Therefore, there will be a discrepancy in the number of friends between Friend Ranking and your profile. For example, if FB displays that you have 1000 friends, the number of ghost accounts is somewhere around a few dozen to 100. When you delete all your friends, the number will not be an absolute 0 friends either. Why? I don't know either.
